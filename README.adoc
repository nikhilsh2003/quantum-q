'''

QuantumQ is a *cloud-native*, *microservice-ready* distributed job queue system engineered for high-throughput *asynchronous processing*. It features a *fault-tolerant* architecture with prioritized queues and exponential backoff retries, all managed through a live, interactive dashboard. The entire system is built for *real-time observability* using Prometheus and Grafana and is deployed automatically via a complete *CI/CD* pipeline.

=== 🏛️ Architecture

The system uses a decoupled API/Worker architecture with Redis as the central broker. Real-time observability is achieved by scraping metrics with Prometheus and visualizing them in Grafana.
